//    Wiesend's Dynamic Link Library is a collection of reusable code that 
//    I've written, or found throughout my programming career. 
//
//    I tried my very best to mention all of the original copyright holders. 
//    I hope that all code which I've copied from others is mentioned and all 
//    their copyrights are given. The copied code (or code snippets) could 
//    already be modified by me or others.

//    I didn't wrote this source totally on my own, this class could be nearly a 
//    clone of the project of James Craig, I did highly get inspired by him, so 
//    this piece of code isn't totally mine, shame on me, I'm not the best!
